# Mental Health Dungeon

The Mental Health Dungeon is an iOS application that provides suers with incentives to pursue tasks that otherwise lack short-term motivational rewards. Designed to target mental health challenges,
users can pursue mindfulness, improvements to bodily health, and more to earn points. These points can then be used to send the user on adventures, where they will advance through multiple dungeon levels
in return for account rewards and inspirational messages.


## Development Details
- This application was developed for the Oregon Institute of Technology's 2025 IDEAFest.
- This was a solo project during my Senior year of college, where I worked on it intermittently between heavy coursework.
- This project was my first interaction with Apple's development ecosystem, and was a valuable experience in learning Swift and Xcode.
- It utilizes Google's Firebase for backend storage and the authentication process.
