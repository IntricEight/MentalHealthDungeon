class Account {
    // TODO: Look into creating a singleton on Swift. That might be a good way to manage this, unless I wanna just use some universl variables that track login status
    // If not a singleton, then a static class might be the preferred method - Research @GlobalActor
    // Using Firebase to store the accounts and manage login process?
    // Another idea is to use the @EnvironmentObject and set the account as an environmental variable?
